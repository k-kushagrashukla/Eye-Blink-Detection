# Eyeblink Detection Using OpenCV
Bascially , it is a detection system where we detect whether a eye is blinked or not ??
## We use these predefined functions for eye blink
```python
face_cascade=cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
eye_cascade=cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_eye_tree_eyeglasses.xml')
```

I made this as a game , where when webcam detect our face , so it will say press `S` to start the game ...........
the game is going to start then and the moment you blink your eye . the game will going to stop.
and again it will ask you to play the game , by pressing `S`.
But for closing the game/window you need to press `Q`
